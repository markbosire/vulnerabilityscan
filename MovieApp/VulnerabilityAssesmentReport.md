**Vulnerability Assessment Report**

**Scan Details:**
- **Scanner Used:** Nikto v2.1.6
- **Target URL:** https://moviearchive.vercel.app/
- **Target IP:** 76.76.21.61
- **Target Port:** 443
- **SSL Information:**
  - Subject: /CN=no-sni.vercel-infra.com
  - Ciphers: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
  - Issuer: /C=US/O=Let's Encrypt/CN=R3
- **Server Information:** Vercel

**Findings:**
1. **X-Frame-Options Header Absent:**
   - The anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present. It is recommended to include this header to mitigate clickjacking attacks.

2. **X-XSS-Protection Header Not Defined:**
   - The X-XSS-Protection header is not defined. Including this header can help protect against some forms of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

3. **Uncommon Headers:**
   - Uncommon headers like 'x-vercel-id,' 'x-vercel-cache,' 'content-disposition,' and 'x-vercel-error' were found. Review and ensure these headers are necessary for the application's functionality, and they do not pose security risks.

4. **X-Content-Type-Options Header Not Set:**
   - The X-Content-Type-Options header is not set. Setting this header is recommended to prevent browsers from interpreting files as a MIME type other than what is specified in the Content-Type header.

5. **Hostname Mismatch in SSL Certificate:**
   - The SSL certificate's Common Name (CN) is 'no-sni.vercel-infra.com,' but the hostname accessed is 'moviearchive.vercel.app.' Ensure SSL certificates match the accessed hostname to prevent potential security risks.

6. **OSVDB-3092: Potential Directory Enumeration:**
   - The scan identified potential directory enumeration vulnerabilities related to '/css' and '/js.' Further investigation is recommended to ensure these directories are adequately protected.

7. **Uncommon Header 'refresh':**
   - An uncommon 'refresh' header was found, redirecting to 'https://vercel.com/'. Ensure this redirection is intended and secure.

8. **CVE-2006-3092: PhpMyFactures Authentication Bypass:**
   - The scan identified a known vulnerability (CVE-2006-3092) in PhpMyFactures 1.2 and earlier. It allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and modify data through direct requests with modified parameters to various PHP files. Immediate action is recommended to address this critical issue.

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement the X-Frame-Options header to prevent clickjacking attacks.
2. Define the X-XSS-Protection header to enhance protection against cross-site scripting.
3. Review and validate the necessity of uncommon headers ('x-vercel-id,' 'x-vercel-cache,' 'content-disposition,' 'x-vercel-error').
4. Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to prevent MIME type confusion attacks.
5. Ensure SSL certificates match the accessed hostname to mitigate security risks.
6. Investigate and secure directories '/css' and '/js' to prevent potential enumeration.
7. Review and secure the 'refresh' header redirection.
8. Urgently address the PhpMyFactures vulnerability (CVE-2006-3092) by applying relevant patches or updates.

**Conclusion:**
The vulnerability scan identified several security issues, including missing security headers, SSL certificate mismatches, potential directory enumeration, and a critical CVE-2006-3092 vulnerability. It is crucial to promptly address these findings to enhance the overall security posture of the web application. Regular security assessments and proactive measures should be implemented to prevent potential threats and vulnerabilities in the future.
